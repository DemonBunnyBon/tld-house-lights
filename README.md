# Overview

The mod allows to turn on lights in all locations with light switches (or even without, with the thl command). Both interior scenes and "outside" locations (such as the Vacant Depot) are supported. 

### Options
+ **Intensity Multiplier**: Modifies how much bright or dim will be the electrical lights by default.
+ **Range Multiplier**: Modifies the range that the electrical lights cast light to.
+ **Turn off aurora light flicker**: Turns off light flickering during auroras.
+ **Shadow casting**: If turned on, lights will cast shadows (can show artifacts and might reduce performance)
+ **Colorless lights**: If turned on, lights will cast a more white light. If not, they will cast light with the default color.
+ **Interaction distance**: Controls how far away from the switch you can interact with it, in meters.
