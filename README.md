# House Lights

Mod for The Long Dark that magically brings electricity back. You can turn lights on and off by using the light switches. If no lightswitch exist, you can toggle lights on/off with the commands 'toggle_lights' or 'thl'. (Side effect: this works outside too)

## Options
+ **Intensity Multiplier**: Modifies how much bright or dim will be the electrical lights by default.
+ **Range Multiplier**: Modifies the range that the electrical lights cast light to.
